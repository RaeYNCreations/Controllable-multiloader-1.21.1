# Controllable
Minecraft: Java Edition has long been missing native controller support. Controllable aims to let players enjoy Java Edition without the limitation of a keyboard and mouse. Start playing Java Edition with full gamepad functionality, letting you play with Xbox, PlayStation, or other controllers in an experience comparable to Bedrock Edition. Controllable includes a range controller-specific features and enhancements to ensure you have seamless controller experience.

### Features:
* **Lots of Settings** - Adjust button mappings, sensistivity, and the plethora of options Controllable offers to fit your exact play style.
* **Analong Movement** - Move freely in 360 degrees, just like you would experience in other games with gamepad support.
* **Context-Based Hints** - On-screen button hints will appear and change depending on your current scenario.
* **Radial Wheel Menu** - Customize and assign game actions to a radial wheel, giving a single button on your controller access to many actions.
* **Accessibility-Friendly** - Offers an alternative input method for players who experience difficulty using a keyboard and mouse. Controllable also offers the ability to select two or more controllers in-game that merge into a single unified controller, giving you the options to create a more comfortable playing experience.
* **Mod Combatibility** - Functions with the majority of mods out of the box with minimal issues.
* **Multi-Instance Support** - Launch Minecraft: Java Edition as many times as you want, just select a different controller for each instance.
* **Tried-and-Tested** - Powered by [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL), a cross-platform library used in many well-known games.

#### Important Notes: 

Analong Movement is disabled when playing on remote servers (e.g. Hypixel) due to anti-cheat plugins. You can override this setting by changing **Analog Movement** from "Local Only" to "Always", however be warned that Controllable _is not resposible_ if you get banned on any server. 

If you are running a multi-instance of Minecraft: Java Edition and want to play on a server/LAN, each instance needs to be signed into a different Microsoft account. **It is recommended** to create custom installations in the launcher where the game directory is pointing to a unique location for each instance, otherwise you will share the same game settings and will not be able to customise button mappings, etc.

Some features are not available on older versions of Controllable. It is recommended to use the newest versions of Controllable and play on the latest version of Minecraft for the best experience. Older versions of Controllable may also be buggy and won't be fixed. MrCrayfish is currently supporting Minecraft 1.20.1 and above.
